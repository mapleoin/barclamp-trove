Welcome to a Barclamp for the Crowbar Framework project
=======================================================

The code and documentation is distributed under the [Apache 2 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

The [Crowbar Framework](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar) was developed by the
[Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team](http://dell.com/openstack) as a [OpenStack](http://OpenStack.org) installer but has
evolved as a much broader function tool. A Barclamp is a module component that implements functionality for Crowbar.
Core barclamps operate the essential functions of the Crowbar deployment mechanics while other barclamps extend the
system for specific applications.

**This functonality of this barclamp DOES NOT stand alone, the Crowbar Framework is required**

About this barclamp
-------------------

This barclamp uses a wrapper cookbook around an upstream/stackforge-style openstack-database-service cookbook. It also includes two additional cookbooks: openstack-common, openstack-identity which are required for their libraries/LWRPs, but no recipes are run from them.


Contributing
------------

This repository contains a copy of the cookbook-openstack-database-service repository which is a git 
subtree. Here are some useful commands to help work with it:

* First add the cookbook repository as a remote

  ```
  $ git remote add cookbook git@github.com:mapleoin/cookbook-openstack-database-service.git
  $ git fetch
  ```

* Then add the git subtree

  ```
  $ git subtree add --prefix chef/cookbooks/openstack-database-service/ --squash cookbook master
  ```

* Now you can push commits done to the upstream cookbook into that repository directly

  ```
  $ git subtree push --prefix=chef/cookbooks/openstack-database-service/ cookbook master
  ```

Do the same for `git@github.com:SUSE-Cloud/cookbook-openstack-common.git` `chef/cookbooks/openstack-common/`.
